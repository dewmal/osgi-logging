This project contains the source code and documentation extracted from articles of my [blog](http://blog.kornr.net).

For a complete discussion of how to OSGi-fy a legacy logging system and how to set up a logging architecture in an OSGi server, please refer to the [Wiki Articles](http://code.google.com/p/osgi-logging/w/list).

For the impatient, or for the people that only want to have a quick overview of the architecture, you can directly go the last article of the series [HERE](http://code.google.com/p/osgi-logging/wiki/OSGiLogging), you don't need to read the other articles of the series, unless you wish to go into the implementation details.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
A fork of the project was started there: https://www.ohloh.net/p/osgi-logging
As I don't work anymore on this code, you may probably find worth getting fresh code from the fork rather than here.
